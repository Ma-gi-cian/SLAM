- Initiated orb for features and descriptors. ORB uses FAST ( features for accelerated segment fast ) and BRIEF descriptors.
- Proposal speaks of using LightGlue [ need to be considered ]

Issue : A common point of concern is that the features detected by a feature descriptor could have issues like uneven distribution. 

- used goodFeaturesToTrack : good distritbution of features found. 
[ /*TODO*/: need to investigate the alternatives ]
[ /*TODO*/: need to understand dense and feature based slam ] 


- using the bruteforce matcher. [ /*TODO*/ : understand this bruteForce matcher ]
